# Heart Attack Risk Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict heart attack risk using health, lifestyle, and demographic factors across global populations. Leveraging a simulated dataset of 8,763 patient records and 24 input features, we applied classification models (SVM, Random Forest, k-NN, Logistic Regression, and more) to evaluate risk. Our analysis includes country-specific insights that can help inform regional prevention strategies and health policy design.

Prepared by: Vy Nguyen, Yanan Sun, Becky Wang, Xinying Wu

Key results include:
- SVM achieved the best overall test accuracy of 64.23%
- Regional feature importance highlighted diverse health drivers, underscoring the importance of localized public health efforts
- Strategic recommendations include tackling obesity, improving diet habits, and focusing on high-risk groups by country

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Heart Attack Prediction Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/heart-attack-prediction-dataset)  
- **Size:** 8,763 records; 24 features in original data, 52 after dummy encoding  
- **Scope:** Includes patients across multiple countries and continents  
- **Two Versions:**
  - `data`: Categorical features as factors
  - `data1`: Dummy-encoded for numerical modeling

### ðŸ“‹ Data Dictionary

This dataset contains **24 health and demographic features** organized into four key categories. See `Reports/Final_Data_Dictionary.pdf` for full definitions.

- **6 Demographic Factors:**  
  `Sex`, `Age`, `Country`, `Continent`, `Hemisphere`, `Income`
- **6 Physiological & Clinical Variables:**  
  `Cholesterol`, `Blood.Pressure (Systolic, Diastolic)`, `Triglycerides`, `Heart.Rate`, `BMI`, `Obesity`
- **5 Medical History Factors:**  
  `Diabetes`, `Family.History`, `Previous.Heart.Problems`, `Medication.Use`, `Stress.Level`
- **7 Lifestyle Factors:**  
  `Smoking`, `Alcohol.Consumption`, `Diet`, `Exercise.Hours.Per.Week`,  
  `Physical.Activity.Days.Per.Week`, `Sedentary.Hours.Per.Day`, `Sleep.Hours.Per.Day`

## Tools & Methodology Overview
**Languages & Libraries:** R (ggplot2, rpart, e1071, randomForest, caret)

### Data Preprocessing:
- Encoded binary and multi-category variables
- Created dummy variables for modeling purposes
- Parsed `Blood.Pressure` into systolic and diastolic values
- Exported two versions of data (factor-based and dummy-encoded)

### Exploratory Analysis:
- Risk distribution across age, gender, country, income
- Correlation heatmaps by feature categories

### Modeling Techniques:
- Logistic Regression  
- Naive Bayes  
- k-NN (with Min-Max and Z-Score scaling)  
- Decision Tree (with pruning)  
- Random Forest (with tuning)  
- SVM (tuned RBF kernel)

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Test set accuracy  
- Country-specific accuracy (for k-NN and Logistic Regression)  
- Confusion matrix analysis

## Results & Key Insights

### Model Performance on Full Dataset

| Model                  | Test Accuracy (%) |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Logistic Regression    | 55.00            |
| Discriminant Analysis  | 50.00            |
| k-NN                   | 51.67            |
| Decision Tree          | 51.32            |
| Random Forest          | 51.37            |
| SVM (Tuned)        | 64.23       |

### k-NN Model Accuracy by Country

| Country        | Test Accuracy (%) |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Italy       | 68             |
| Japan       | 66             |
| United States  | 49                |
| China          | 48                |

### Strategic Health Implications

- **Italy** should prioritize **obesity reduction**, **healthcare access for low-income populations**, and **monitoring patients with heart history**
- **Japan** should focus on **preventive care**, including **heart rate monitoring**, **diet improvement**, and **specialized services** for prior heart conditions
- Localized patterns suggest health campaigns and interventions must be **region-specific** rather than generic

## Key Deliverables
- R script: `Heart_Attack_Risk_Prediction.R`  
- Final presentation (PDF)  
- Data dictionary and appendix (PDF)

## What I Learned
- **Model assumptions matter**: Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes underperformed due to linearity and independence assumptions  
- **SVMs are powerful** for non-linear patterns but require careful parameter tuning  
- Country-level breakdowns provide more actionable insights than global averages  
- Data quality and balance are essential; simulated data can lead to model bias

## What I Plan to Improve
- Test on real-world healthcare datasets (e.g., UCI Heart Disease)
- Explore deep learning or ensemble stacking models
- Integrate time-based features for longitudinal health analysis
- Conduct deeper regional analysis across more countries
