# Heart Attack Risk Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict heart attack risk using health, lifestyle, and demographic factors through various machine learning models. By analyzing a simulated dataset across 24 variables and multiple countries, we built models to understand patterns and potential prevention strategies for cardiovascular disease.

Prepared by: Vy Nguyen, Yanan Sun, Becky Wang, Xinying Wu

Key results include:
- SVM (Tuned) achieved the highest global accuracy of **64%**
- KNN performed **well on country subsets**, especially Italy and Japan
- Random Forest, despite tuning, showed strong overfitting
- Key features varied by country, highlighting the need for regional strategies

## Dataset
- **Source:** AI-generated simulated dataset
- **Size:** 8,763 records; 24 features in original data, 52 after dummy encoding
- **Scope:** Includes patients across multiple countries and continents
- **Two Versions:**
  - `data`: Categorical features as factors
  - `data1`: Dummy-encoded for numerical modeling

### ðŸ“‹ Data Dictionary

This dataset contains **24 health and demographic features** organized into four key categories. The definitions and descriptions for each variable are provided in the `Final_Data_Dictionary.pdf` file located in the `Reports/` folder.

- **6 Demographic Factors**:  
  `Sex`, `Age`, `Country`, `Continent`, `Hemisphere`, `Income`
- **6 Physiological & Clinical Variables**:  
  `Cholesterol`, `Blood.Pressure (Systolic, Diastolic)`, `Triglycerides`, `Heart.Rate`, `BMI`, `Obesity`
- **5 Medical History Factors**:  
  `Diabetes`, `Family.History`, `Previous.Heart.Problems`, `Medication.Use`, `Stress.Level`
- **7 Lifestyle Factors**:  
  `Smoking`, `Alcohol.Consumption`, `Diet`,  
  `Exercise.Hours.Per.Week`, `Physical.Activity.Days.Per.Week`,  
  `Sedentary.Hours.Per.Day`, `Sleep.Hours.Per.Day`

## Tools & Methodology Overview
**Languages & Libraries:** R (ggplot2, rpart, e1071, randomForest, caret)

### Data Preprocessing:
- Encoded binary and multi-category variables
- Created dummies for categorical features for specific models
- Engineered `Systolic` and `Diastolic` from `Blood.Pressure`
- Exported both factor-based and dummy-encoded datasets

### Exploratory Analysis:
- Distribution of risk across gender, age, income, country
- Correlation matrices by factor groups (demographic, lifestyle, etc.)

### Modeling Techniques:
- Logistic Regression (global & by country)
- Naive Bayes (global & by country)
- KNN (Min-Max & Z-Score normalization, regional tuning)
- Decision Tree (pruning & country-specific)
- Random Forest (feature tuning, importance analysis)
- SVM (global and regional, parameter tuning)

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy on train/test splits
- Confusion matrices for classification performance
- Country-specific breakdowns

## Results & Key Insights
- **SVM outperformed** other models on the global dataset (~64% test accuracy)
- **KNN was most effective** for Italy and Japan; accuracy up to ~66%
- Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes showed **limitations due to assumptions**
- Random Forest models consistently overfit, with 100% training accuracy
- Key regional predictors:
  - Italy: Obesity, BMI, Medication Use
  - Japan: Heart Rate, Diet, Medication Use
  - US: Income, Physical Activity, Triglycerides

## Key Deliverables

- Final presentation (PDF)
- Appendix and data dictionary (PDF)
  
## What I Learned
- Model assumptions matter: Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression underperformed due to oversimplified assumptions
- SVMs can capture non-linear patterns better, but tuning is crucial
- Data quality and balance are essential; simulated data can lead to model bias
- Dummy encoding is necessary for algorithms like KNN and SVM

## What I Plan to Improve
- Test on real-world healthcare datasets (e.g., UCI Heart Disease)
- Explore deep learning or ensemble stacking models
- Integrate time-based features for longitudinal health analysis
- Conduct deeper regional analysis across more countries
